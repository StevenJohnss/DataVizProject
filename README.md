## Project Overview

DataVizProject is a comprehensive data visualization tool that allows users to upload, analyze, and visualize complex datasets. It provides an intuitive interface for creating various types of charts and graphs, making data interpretation accessible to users of all skill levels.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Data upload and management
- Interactive chart creation (line, bar, pie, scatter plots)
- Real-time data updates
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- API integration for external data sources

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Containerization: Docker
- Orchestration: Kubernetes

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DataVizProject.git
   cd DataVizProject
   ```

2. Start the development environment:
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

For production deployment, use:

docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build


## Development Process

Our development process followed these key steps:

1. Requirements gathering and analysis
2. System design and architecture planning
3. Frontend and backend development in parallel
4. Integration of frontend and backend
5. Containerization with Docker
6. Kubernetes configuration for deployment
7. Continuous testing and refinement

## Technical Challenges

## Technical Challenges

During development, I faced and overcame several challenges specific to data visualization:

1. Dimensionality reduction: Implemented t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) for visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D space.

2. Interactive visualizations: Developed custom D3.js components to create responsive and interactive chart.


## Strategic Decisions

Key decisions that shaped our project:

1. Choosing React for its component-based architecture and large ecosystem.
2. Opting for Flask due to its lightweight nature and easy integration with Python data processing libraries.
3. Using Docker for consistency across development and production environments.
4. Implementing Kubernetes for scalability and easier management of microservices.

## Scripts

Here are the main scripts used in our project:
typescript:frontend/package.json


To run these scripts:

1. For development: 
   - Frontend: `npm start` in the frontend directory
   - Backend: `python main.py` in the backend directory
2. For production build: `npm run build` in the frontend directory
3. For tests: 
   - Frontend: `npm test` in the frontend directory
   - Backend: `python -m pytest` in the backend directory


## Deployment

To deploy the application:

1. Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster set up.
2. Apply the Kubernetes configurations:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```
3. Access the application through the Ingress IP or domain name.

For detailed deployment instructions, refer to our Kubernetes configuration files in the `k8s/` directory.

## Future Improvements

- Implement machine learning models for predictive analytics
- Add more chart types and customization options
- Develop a mobile app version
- Integrate with more third-party data sources
